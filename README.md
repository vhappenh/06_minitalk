# minitalk

"Minitalk" is a project focused on coding a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. 
The goal is to create a C program that can exchange data between two processes via signals. 
The project introduces students to the concept of using signals for inter-process communication. 
The main objectives include understanding UNIX signals, implementing signal handling in C, and developing a functional data exchange mechanism. 
The project follows common instructions such as adherence to the Norm, proper memory management, and Makefile requirements.
